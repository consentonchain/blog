There was recently some discussion about BIP 47 on Twitter and some developers
believe its bad for privacy because of address reuse in notification transactions.
In this post I will share my thoughts and an experiment using BIP 47 payment code.


## What is BIP 47 and how does reusable payment code help?

Problem: Bob wants to accept payments without interacting with each sender to share
a new address privately.

Solution: BIP 47 payment code that can be shared publicly. Every sender gets a new
address to pay Bob. Requires no server or scanning.

[BIP 47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) was written
by Justus Ranvier. [Recent version](https://github.com/OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject/rfc/blob/master/obpp-05.mediawiki)
(v3 and v4) is maintained in a different repository.

## What is a notification transaction?

Before Alice sends any bitcoin to Bob, she must share her payment code with him.
She creates a transaction that sends a small amount of bitcoin to Bob's notification
address. Alice adds an OP_RETURN output to her transaction which consists of payment
code only readable by Bob.

=========================================================================================
Inputs selected for this transaction and change output should be coinjoined to avoid
any privacy issues. Outputs received to notification addresses must not be used as inputs
for any transaction.
=========================================================================================

Alternate Notification Methods:

_kdmukai_ opened a [pull request](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/165) last
week that could use nostr for BIP 47 notifications.

## Experiment using BIP 47

1. Create a testnet wallet w1 in Sparrow and send some coins from a faucet.
2. Do coinjoin for one of the UTXO.
3. Create a testnet wallet in Samourai app and get the BIP 47 payment code from it.
4. Try to pay the BIP 47 payment code and this will initiate notification transaction.
Use the coinjoined UTXO for this transaction.

   Notification Tx: [`41c5d62a2359341fe9563f17e2f5564cf6bb9bdf6dce34ff6fd245ef3b80ea3c`](https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/41c5d62a2359341fe9563f17e2f5564cf6bb9bdf6dce34ff6fd245ef3b80ea3c)

5. Create another wallet w2 in Sparrow and repeat the same process without doing coinjoin.

   Notification Tx: [`70ffa9eec8fb69e5539685e8b9356e09263404d7246e67e5d2d297060bb097b5`](https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/70ffa9eec8fb69e5539685e8b9356e09263404d7246e67e5d2d297060bb097b5)

6. Send some bitcoin to the payment code using wallet w1 and use UTXO from 'deposit' section.
Change from the notification transaction is separate and present in 'post-mix' section with
appropriate label.

   Transaction: [`d56ad10e4c13fc6528c0119da787a2d377e192da0e5f2603fdb18a7d47eafcf2`](https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/d56ad10e4c13fc6528c0119da787a2d377e192da0e5f2603fdb18a7d47eafcf2)

Since both notification transactions are sent to the same address `mpQ6Hm1LV7HhKaP4YAFzwVE6pArhqFvDpd`,
chain analysis would reveal that someone is using this address for BIP 47. However, they won't know the
sender, receiver of the transaction involved in the actual payment in step 6 and payment code added in OP_RETURN.
